  id: windows-service-to-lambda
  name: Windows Service to AWS Lambda Migration
  version: 1.0.0
  owner: Cloud Migration Engineering
  intent: >
    Migrates .NET Framework 4.x Windows Service executables to AWS Lambda serverless
    functions. Analyses service source code, classifies complexity, generates Lambda handlers
    (C# .NET 10 isolated worker), produces Terraform HCL or CloudFormation YAML
    for all supporting AWS infrastructure, and outputs integration test stubs with mocked AWS
    SDK clients. Generic and reusable — not tied to any specific application name, business
    domain, or database platform.
  recommended_agent: windows-service-to-lambda
  execution_model: instruction-only with sequential skill gates and complexity-tiered lanes
  scope:
    includes:
      - Windows Service source code scanning (ServiceBase derivatives, timers, event handlers)
      - Trigger classification (timer interval → EventBridge cron, file watcher → S3 event, etc.)
      - ADO.NET data-access extraction (stored procedures, connection string keys, database names)
      - Windows-specific API surface identification (EventLog, Registry, ServiceController)
      - Complexity classification (Low / Medium / High) with timeout risk analysis
      - Lambda handler generation for Low and Medium complexity services (.NET 10)
      - Windows-to-Lambda pattern adaptation (see references/pattern-mapping.md)
      - IaC generation: EventBridge Scheduler, Lambda function, IAM role, SQS DLQ, Secrets Manager bindings, CloudWatch log group and alarms (Terraform HCL or CloudFormation YAML)
      - Integration test stub generation with mocked AWS SDK clients (Moq)
      - Trigger payload synthesis from IaC schedule config
      - Baseline fixture capture test mode for data-parity validation
      - High-complexity service review brief production (no code generation)
      - Migration reporting (self-contained HTML)
    excludes:
      - Deployment to AWS (Lambda function deployment, CloudFormation stack creation, Terraform apply)
      - Secret value provisioning (Secrets Manager / SSM values are referenced, not populated)
      - Step Functions workflow authoring (flagged as a recommendation only)
      - RDS Proxy provisioning (connection strings are updated to point to RDS Proxy; the proxy itself is not provisioned)
      - Modification of High-complexity services without explicit developer sign-off
      - Automated migration of MSDTC distributed transactions (manual gate required)
      - Behavioural changes to stored procedure calls or SQL command text
      - Modification of *.designer.vb, *.designer.cs, or auto-generated installer files
  inputs_required:
    - solutionFolder: "Absolute path to the repository root containing the .sln file"
    - sourceFramework: "Framework moniker of the service projects, e.g. net40, net462, net48"
    - iacToolchain: "IaC output format — terraform or cloudformation"
    - lambdaRuntime: "Target Lambda runtime — dotnet10"
    - awsRegion: "AWS deployment region, e.g. eu-west-2"
  outputs:
    - "migration-output/service-inventory.json — service list, triggers, patterns, complexity grades, risk flags"
    - "migration-output/migration-plan.json — phase breakdown, decisions, effort, review gates"
    - "migration-output/handlers/<ServiceName>/ — Lambda handler source files"
    - "migration-output/terraform/<ServiceName>/ — main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf (if Terraform)"
    - "migration-output/cloudformation/<ServiceName>/ — template.yaml (if CloudFormation)"
    - "migration-output/tests/<ServiceName>/ — test project with stubs and fixture data"
    - "migration-output/review-briefs/<ServiceName>.md — High-complexity service review briefs"
    - "migration-output/migration-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.html — self-contained HTML report"
  success_criteria:
    - All Low and Medium complexity services have generated handlers, IaC, and test stubs
    - All High-complexity services have a review brief; no handler code generated without sign-off
    - Generated handlers build with zero errors (dotnet build)
    - No plaintext secrets in any generated file
    - No Windows file paths (backslashes, drive letters) in generated handlers or IaC
    - migration-output/ added to .gitignore
  safety:
    - Never hardcode secrets of any kind — use Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable sourced from Secrets Manager.
    - Never generate handler code for High-complexity services without explicit developer sign-off.
    - Never use msbuild or nuget.exe to build generated handlers — they target .NET 10 SDK.
    - Never copy ServiceBase, ProjectInstaller, or System.ServiceProcess code into handlers.
    - Never emit Windows file paths in generated handlers or IaC files.
    - Never alter stored procedure names, parameter names, or SQL command text without sign-off.
    - Never exceed the 15-minute Lambda timeout without flagging and requiring chunking.
    - Always add migration-output/ to .gitignore.

# Windows Service to AWS Lambda Migration (Skill)

This skill package provides a repeatable, complexity-tiered migration workflow for lifting
.NET Framework 4.x Windows Services to AWS Lambda. It covers analysis, planning, handler
generation, IaC generation, test stub generation, and reporting.

Execution model: **instruction-only with sequential skill gates and complexity-tiered lanes**.

---

## Complexity Lanes

| Lane | Complexity | Approach |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Lane 1 | Low | Fully automated — handler, IaC, and tests generated without gates |
| Lane 2 | Medium | Automated generation + mandatory developer review gate before IaC apply |
| Lane 3 | High | Review brief only — no handler code generated; developer sign-off required |

## Execution Sequence

```
[START]
  │
  ▼
1. service-inventory    ← READ-ONLY; produces complexity grades and risk flags
  │  complexity = Low | Medium | High (per service)
  ▼
2. migration-planning   ← interview user; assigns lanes; records all decisions
  │  Lane 1 (Low) → auto-generate
  │  Lane 2 (Medium) → generate + review gate
  │  Lane 3 (High) → review brief only
  ▼
3. handler-generation   ← Lane 1 + Lane 2 only; High-complexity services skip to step 6
  │  Translates Windows patterns to Lambda equivalents (see references/pattern-mapping.md)
  ▼
4. iac-generation       ← all Lane 1 + Lane 2 services
  │  Terraform HCL or CloudFormation YAML per function
  ▼
5. test-stub-generation ← all Lane 1 + Lane 2 services
  │  xUnit (dotnet10) with mocked AWS SDK
  ▼
6. high-complexity-review ← Lane 3 services only
  │  Review brief produced; no handler code written
  ▼
7. migration-reporting  ← ALWAYS runs; collects all outputs, writes HTML report
  │
  ▼
[END]
