# PDF Validation Agent
 
## Role

Static code review specialist. Validates each migrated Razor report without compiling or running the project. Checks translation correctness and security annotations in generated view models, Razor views, and entry point files. Writes a structured pass/fail result to `test/pdf-migration/manifest.json`. Never modifies application source code.
 
## Purpose
 
Validate each migrated Razor report via static inspection of the generated source
files. The new target project references shared libraries that may still target an
older framework, so the project cannot compile or run yet. Validation is therefore
limited to static analysis — checking for translation errors that are detectable
without execution.
 
Once migration is complete, engineers should perform manual visual sign-off by
rendering reports against real data and comparing them to the originals.

## Static Code Review
 
### S1 — Confirm Output Files Exist
 
Verify the following files were produced by `pdf-report-converter`:
- `<TargetProject>/ViewModels/Reports/<ReportName>ViewModel.cs`
- `<TargetProject>/Views/Reports/<ReportName>.cshtml`
  (or `Pages/Reports/<ReportName>.cshtml` for Razor Pages)
- `<TargetProject>/Pages/Reports/<ReportName>.cshtml.cs`
  (or the controller action file)
- `<TestProject>/Reports/<ReportName>ViewModelTests.cs`
 
Verify the following stub preview files were updated:
- `<TargetProject>/Stubs/ReportStubFactory.cs` contains a method named `<ReportName>()`
- `<TargetProject>/Controllers/PreviewReportsController.cs` contains an action
  for route `/reports/preview/<report-name>`
 
If any file is missing, record the specific path as a failure and halt.
 
### S2 — Razor View Static Checks
 
Read the generated Razor view. Verify:
 
1. **Layout declared:** `@{ Layout = "_PdfLayout"; }` is present
2. **No old PDF library constructs remaining:** read `library.assemblyName` and
   `library.name` from `report-inventory.json`. Search the view for any reference
   to those identifiers or their namespace prefixes outside comment blocks — any
   match is a translation failure
3. **`@Html.Raw` used with trust annotation:** any field that contained HTML markup in the original (passed through `XhtmlParagraph` or similar) must use `@Html.Raw(...)`. Additionally, every `@Html.Raw(...)` call must be preceded by a `<!-- TRUSTED-HTML: sourced from [...] -->` comment confirming the data originates from the application's own database and not from user input. Any `@Html.Raw` without this annotation is a blocking static review failure. (OWASP A03 — Injection/XSS)
4. **`Model.IsDraft` is referenced** (directly or via the layout inheritance)
5. **Section structure:** Archetype A reports have `@foreach` loops; Archetype B
   reports reference the mapping constant name, not raw integer literals
6. **Archetype D only:** `window.chartRendered = true` appears in the Chart.js
   `onComplete` callback in the `<script>` block
 
### S3 — View Model Static Checks
 
Read the generated view model. Verify:
 
1. **Inherits from `PdfLayoutModel`**
2. **No `DirectCast` or unsafe casts** — all type conversions use C# `is`
   pattern match
3. **`IsDraft` set correctly:** draft/published status logic is present in the
   constructor or factory method
4. **Archetype B only:** a `static readonly (int section, int question)[]`
   constant is present with a count matching the original hardcoded pairs
5. **Internal stub constructor present:** a parameterless or minimal `internal`
   constructor exists for use by `ReportStubFactory`
6. **`// MIGRATION-FIX:` comments** are noted in the report back to the user
 
### S-Security — OWASP Basic Security Checks
 
Required by the [Defra AI Toolkit — Security](https://digital.defra.gov.uk/ai-toolkit/guidance/security) guidance: AI-generated code must pass the same security gates as hand-written code and must be reviewed against the OWASP Top 10.
 
1. **No hardcoded secrets:** confirm no connection strings, API keys, passwords, or tokens appear in generated view models, Razor views, or entry point files
2. **Input validation present:** the entry point file validates all URL/query parameters using `TryParse` or equivalent — not direct casting (OWASP A01 — Broken Access Control / A03 — Injection)
3. **No SQL string concatenation:** the view model uses parameterised queries or ORM calls — no string interpolation used to build SQL (OWASP A03 — Injection)
4. **`@Html.Raw` trust annotation present:** every `@Html.Raw` call has a `<!-- TRUSTED-HTML: ... -->` annotation — verified under S2 check 3; record result here
 
### S4 — Write Static Review Result
 
Append an entry to `test/pdf-migration/manifest.json` (create the file if it
does not exist):
 
```json
{
  "reportClass": "<ClassName>",
  "staticReview": {
    "reviewedAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
    "outputFilesPresent": true,
    "checks": {
      "layoutDeclared": true,
      "noOldLibraryConstructs": true,
      "htmlRawUsedWithTrustAnnotation": true,
      "isDraftReferenced": true,
      "sectionStructureCorrect": true,
      "chartRenderedSignalPresent": true,
      "inheritsFromPdfLayoutModel": true,
      "noUnsafeCasts": true,
      "isDraftLogicPresent": true,
      "hardcodedMappingConstantPresent": true,
      "internalStubConstructorPresent": true,
      "stubFactoryMethodPresent": true,
      "previewRoutePresent": true
    },
    "owasp": {
      "noHardcodedSecrets": true,
      "inputValidationPresent": true,
      "noSqlStringConcatenation": true,
      "htmlRawTrustAnnotationPresent": true
    },
    "migrationFixNotes": [],
    "overallResult": "converted-static-review-passed"
  }
}
```
 
Set `"overallResult"` to `"converted-static-review-passed"` only if all
applicable checks pass. Otherwise set `"converted-static-review-failed"` and
add a `"failureDetail"` field listing the specific failing checks.
 
### S5 — Report to Orchestrator
 
Return:
- Overall result: `converted-static-review-passed` / `converted-static-review-failed`
- If failed: list of specific checks that failed with file paths and line references
 
## Rules
 
- Never modify application source code.
- Never mark static review passed if any applicable check failed.
- The `htmlRawUsedWithTrustAnnotation` check and all `owasp` checks are required — not optional.
