## Available Agents

### Database Migration Agent

**Entry point**: `.github/agents/db-migration.agent.md`

Helps engineers migrate databases between platforms — Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, and more. Covers the full migration lifecycle: schema analysis, data model advisory, schema conversion, compatibility fixing, performance tuning, validation, and reporting.

**Modes**:

- **Auto mode** — `@db-migration migrate my Oracle database to PostgreSQL` — runs all phases sequentially, pausing after analysis for confirmation.
- **Manual mode** — `@db-migration analyse my database` — runs a single phase.

**Skills** (under `.github/skills/db-migration/`):

### Service Modernisation Agent (WCF / ASMX → REST)

**Entry point**: `.github/agents/service-modernisation-wcf-asmx-to-rest.agent.md`

Converts legacy WCF and ASMX service contracts to modern REST APIs and direct in-process calls using a complexity-tiered migration strategy. Designed for large-scale service modernisation projects.

**Modes**:

- **`analyse`** — Introspect WCF/ASMX files, WSDL contracts, and operation signatures; classify services as Low/Medium/High complexity; output inventory with risk flags.
- **`plan`** — Interview for architectural and sequencing decisions; produce a zero-ambiguity modernisation plan with phase breakdown, effort estimates, and manual review gates.
- **`generate-low-medium`** — Generate ASP.NET Core REST controllers, request/response DTOs, OpenAPI annotations, and data-parity integration tests for Low and Medium-complexity services.
- **`review-high-complexity`** — Produce structured review briefs for High-complexity services (e.g., Tabulation, DistributionForComment) with domain logic analysis, risk assessment, and guided refactor recommendations (no auto-conversion).
- **`generate-inprocess`** — Generate direct in-process call adapters and CSLA BO wrappers for application services, preserving data-type fidelity.
- **`cleanup-project-references`** — Remove web references, WSDL/.disco/.map files, and orphaned `using` statements from project files.
- **`full-pipeline`** — End-to-end orchestration: analyse → plan → generate Low/Medium → review High-complexity → (optional) in-process transform → cleanup → report.

**Skills** (under `.github/skills/service-modernisation/`):

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `service-analysis` | Parse WCF/ASMX contracts, extract operation signatures, assess complexity (Low/Medium/High) |
| `migration-planning` | Interview for architecture/sequencing, output zero-ambiguity plan with phases and risk gates |
| `rest-conversion-low-medium` | Generate REST controllers, DTOs, OpenAPI annotations for straightforward services |
| `high-complexity-review-brief` | Produce structured review guides for critical services requiring manual refactor |
| `inprocess-transformation-csla` | Generate adapters wrapping CSLA BOs for direct in-process calls (application) |
| `project-cleanup` | Remove obsolete web references and update project files |
| `data-parity-testing` | Generate integration tests comparing original ASMX output vs new REST/in-process output |
| `migration-reporting` | Synthesise plan, converted services, review briefs, and timeline into final report |

**Key outputs**:

- `service-analysis.json` — Service inventory with operation count, type complexity, and risk flags
- `service-modernisation-plan.json` — Sequenced plan with phases, effort, and manual review gates
- Generated REST controllers with routes, DTOs, and OpenAPI annotations
- Data-parity integration tests comparing original vs new implementations
- High-complexity review briefs with domain logic, risk analysis, and refactor guidance
- Cleaned project files with removed web references and updated using statements
- Migration report with completion summary and next-step checklist

**Risk mitigation**:

- High-complexity services are **never silently converted**; instead, a structured review brief with risk analysis and recommended refactor approach is produced
- All converted services include integration tests validating data-parity between original and new implementations
- Project cleanup removes dangling references and orphaned code

**Sequencing example** (Service A + Service B) :

- **Phase 1**: Service B — low‑complexity analysis and initial generation (lane 1)
- **Phase 2**: Service B — medium‑complexity review and refactoring (lane 2); Service A analysis begins (lane 1)
- **Phase 3**: Service A — API/controller generation; Service B — high‑complexity review gates with manual refactoring
- **Phase 4**: Integration testing and production deployment

- **`convert-backend`** — Translate VB.NET class libraries to C# 14 file-by-file with no behavioural change.
- **`convert-ui`** — Convert `.aspx` / `.ascx` / `.master` to MVC Controllers + Razor Views + ViewModels + `wwwroot/`; preserve visual layout.
- **`generate-tests`** — Generate xUnit test projects using `WebApplicationFactory<Program>`, Moq, and FluentAssertions.
- **`build-and-verify`** — Run `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, and smoke `curl` probes against the running site.
- **`full-pipeline`** — End-to-end orchestration ending in `modernisation-report.md`.

**Skill**: `.github/skills/vbnet-to-csharp-net10-mvc-modernizer/vbnet-csharp-mvc-modernisation.skill.md`

**Key outputs**:

- `modernisation-analysis.json` and `modernisation-plan.json`
- Modernised solution under `modernised/` (Core / Infrastructure / Web MVC / Tests, `net10.0`, `LangVersion=14.0`, SDK-style projects, `PackageReference`)
- Controllers, Razor views, ViewModels, `_Layout.cshtml`, `wwwroot/` assets
- xUnit test projects with happy-path controller and service tests
- `build-report.md` (build + test + smoke evidence) and `modernisation-report.md` (file map, deferred items, package-swap impact, visual-parity checklist)

**Risk mitigation**:

- Backend conversion is **syntactical only**; algorithmic changes require explicit user sign-off per file
- Visual parity is mandatory — field order, labels, column layout, and button placement must match the legacy screens
- Package swaps with behaviour impact (e.g. `Newtonsoft.Json` ↔ `System.Text.Json`) are listed and confirmed before generation
- Risky idioms (`On Error Resume Next`, late binding, `Server.Transfer`, `UpdatePanel`, custom HTTP modules) are surfaced as manual-review items rather than silently translated
