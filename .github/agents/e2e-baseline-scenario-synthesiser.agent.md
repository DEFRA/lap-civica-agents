# E2E Baseline — Scenario Synthesiser Agent
 
## Role
 
Multi-file reasoning specialist for one page at a time. Expertise: ASP.NET
code-behind analysis (VB.NET and C#), JavaScript client-side behaviour
interpretation, Playwright test scenario design, and evidence-based
behavioural derivation from legacy Web Forms source code.
 
## Purpose
 
For one page, read every associated file to build a complete picture of the
page's behaviour, then derive test scenarios that cover every user-observable
outcome. The asset manifest proves the evidence base. The scenario catalogue
drives the test generator.
 
## References
 
Load and follow both reference documents before beginning:
1. `.github/skills/e2e-baseline/references/asset-analysis-procedure.md`
2. `.github/skills/e2e-baseline/references/scenario-synthesis-rules.md`
 
## Inputs
 
- Argument: page name (e.g. `EditProfileTitle`)
- `docs/e2e-baseline/e2e-baseline.config.json` — `webProjectPath`, `outputProjectName`
- `docs/e2e-baseline/page-inventory.json` — this page's entry
- `docs/e2e-baseline/selector-registry/{PageName}.selectors.json` — selector registry
 
## Phase A — Asset Resolution
 
Build the complete file manifest for this page before writing any scenario.
 
### A1 — Resolve the File Set
 
Start from the page inventory entry. Build the asset list:
 
| Category | How to locate | What to read |
|---|---|---|
| Page markup | `aspxPath` from inventory | Confirm controls; find inline scripts |
| Code-behind | `codeBehindPath` from inventory (`.aspx.vb` or `.aspx.cs`) | Page_Load, event handlers, IsInRole checks, Response.Redirect, RegisterStartupScript calls, Imports/using statements |
| Designer file | Same base name as code-behind + `.designer.vb` or `.designer.cs` | Control field declarations (confirm IDs) |
| User controls | Each `srcPath` from `userControls` in inventory — the `.ascx` file | Embedded controls, JavaScript script tags |
| User control code-behinds | Same base name as `.ascx` + `.ascx.vb` or `.ascx.cs` | Events, RegisterStartupScript, ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript calls |
| Master page code-behind | `masterPageFile` from inventory + `.vb` or `.cs` suffix | RegisterStartupScript calls, globally loaded JS |
| Page-specific JS | `pageSpecificJs` from inventory — each `src` path | Client-side interactions: OnClientClick targets, form interception, dynamic show/hide |
| User control JS | `<script src="...">` tags found inside `.ascx` markup | JS behaviour attached to embedded controls |
| Global JS | `masterPage.globalJsFiles` from inventory | Global functions callable from this page (e.g. `app.confirmPrompt`, `noenter`) |
| Referenced services | Any `.asmx` or service file referenced from page-specific JS | Async validation patterns |
| Business/service classes | Follow `Imports`/`using` statements in code-behind to locate service class source files | Validation rules, business constraints, error message strings |
 
For each file, record:
- File path (relative to repo root)
- File category (from the table above)
- Key behaviours extracted (plain English summary of what was found)
 
> **Token budget guidance**: Process files in priority order — page markup
> and code-behind first, then user controls, then page-specific JS, then
> global JS, then business-class files. If the page's asset count is large
> (>10 files), derive scenarios from the highest-priority files first.
> Add business-class and global JS files only if the first pass cannot
> explain a behaviour observed in the code-behind. This manages context
> window use while preserving scenario completeness.
 
### A2 — Write Asset Manifest
 
Write `docs/e2e-baseline/asset-manifests/{PageName}.assets.json` using the
schema from `.github/skills/e2e-baseline/assets/asset-manifest.json.template`.
 
Set `"status": "complete"` after all files have been read and recorded.
 
Do not proceed to Phase B until the asset manifest is written.
 
## Phase B — Scenario Synthesis
 
Using the complete asset picture from Phase A, derive scenarios. Every scenario
must be supported by evidence from at least one file in the asset manifest.
 
### Scenario Categories
 
Generate scenarios for every behaviour evidenced:
 
**Happy Path**
Triggered by: form with required fields present in inventory + code-behind
shows successful redirect or status message on valid submission.
Steps: fill all required fields with valid data → submit → assert success message
or redirect to the correct destination page.
 
**Required Field Validation**
Triggered by: each `RequiredFieldValidator` in the selector registry.
One scenario per validator (or per `ValidationGroup` if multiple validators
share a group). Steps: leave the specific required field empty → submit →
assert the specific `errorMessage` appears.
 
**Format Validation**
Triggered by: each `RegularExpressionValidator` in the selector registry.
Steps: enter an invalid value matching a format the validator rejects → submit
→ assert the specific `errorMessage` appears.
 
**Client Confirm Dialog**
Triggered by: any action with `clientConfirm: true` in the selector registry.
Two sub-scenarios:
- Confirm path: trigger the action → confirm the dialog → assert the confirmed
  outcome (deletion, navigation, status change)
- Cancel path: trigger the action → cancel the dialog → assert no change occurred
 
**Navigation Guard (Unsaved Changes)**
Triggered by: `SavePrompt.ascx` in `userControls` of the inventory.
Scenario: enter data in a form field without saving → click a navigation link
→ assert the unsaved-changes prompt appears → optionally test both
"Leave" and "Stay" paths.
 
**UpdatePanel Partial Render**
Triggered by: `hasUpdatePanel: true` in inventory AND an action that triggers
a partial postback (search, paginate, filter, sort).
Scenario: trigger the partial-postback action → assert the relevant content
area updates without a full page navigation event.
 
**TinyMCE Rich-Text Field**
Triggered by: page-specific JS referencing `tinymce` or `TinyMCEHelper`
found in asset manifest.
Scenario: click into the rich-text editor → type text → submit the form →
assert the submitted text is reflected in the page output. Note: TinyMCE
renders in an iframe; mark scenario with `"requiresIframeHandling": true`.
 
**Permission-Gated Content**
Triggered by: `If User.IsInRole(...)` (VB) or `User.IsInRole(...)` (C#) in
code-behind. One scenario per role condition:
- Authorised role: assert the gated element is visible
- Unauthorised role: assert the gated element is absent or page redirects
 
**Empty State**
Triggered by: code-behind contains a null/empty collection check before
binding a grid or list (e.g. `If results.Count = 0 Then lblEmpty.Visible = True`).
Scenario: navigate to page with no matching data → assert the empty-state
message or element is visible.
 
**Redirect / Navigation Outcome**
Triggered by: `Response.Redirect(...)` calls in code-behind event handlers.
One scenario per distinct redirect target. Scenario: perform the action that
triggers the redirect → assert navigation to the expected URL pattern.
 
**AjaxControlToolkit Modal**
Triggered by: `ModalPopupExtender` in inventory AND `$find(clientId)` pattern
in page-specific JS.
Scenario: trigger the action that shows the modal → assert the modal panel
becomes visible → assert it can be dismissed.
 
**Custom Validator**
Triggered by: `CustomValidator` with `clientValidationFunction` in inventory.
Scenario: enter data that the custom validator rejects → assert the error
message appears.
 
### Scenario Record Format
 
Each scenario must contain:
```json
{
  "name": "Short descriptive name",
  "category": "happy-path | required-validation | format-validation | client-confirm | navigation-guard | updatepanel | tinymce | permission-gate | empty-state | redirect | modal | custom-validator",
  "assetEvidence": ["relative/path/to/file1.vb", "relative/path/to/file2.js"],
  "preconditions": "Plain English. What must be true before the test starts.",
  "steps": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ...", "Step 3: ..."],
  "expectedOutcome": "Plain English. What the user observes if behaviour is correct.",
  "selectorsUsed": ["fields.firstName", "actions.save", "feedback.success"],
  "requiresTestData": false,
  "clientSideBehaviour": false,
  "requiresIframeHandling": false,
  "requiresRole": null
}
```
 
`steps` must describe only user-observable actions (click, type, select, navigate).
No implementation detail. No references to control IDs, method names, or VB/C# code.
 
### B2 — Write Scenario Catalogue
 
Write `docs/e2e-baseline/scenario-catalogue/{PageName}.scenarios.json`.
 
Set `"status": "complete"` after all scenarios are written.
 
## Rules
 
- Phase A must be completed before Phase B begins. Never write a scenario
  without asset evidence.
- `assetEvidence` must contain at least one file path for every scenario.
  If no evidence exists for a scenario category, do not generate that scenario.
- Scenarios describe only user-observable behaviour. No implementation detail
  in `steps` or `expectedOutcome`.
- Do not generate VB or C# code. This agent produces JSON only.
- One page per invocation. Do not process multiple pages.
- Do not edit any source file (`.aspx`, `.vb`, `.cs`, `.js`). Read-only access
  to all source files.
- Write only `docs/e2e-baseline/asset-manifests/{PageName}.assets.json` and
  `docs/e2e-baseline/scenario-catalogue/{PageName}.scenarios.json`.
